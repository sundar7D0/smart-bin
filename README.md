# smart-bin
Smart waste-segregator bin that categorizes waste into 4 categories

Trained DL models to demarcate waste with ∼95% accuracy into 4 categories: paper, composite, plastic & wet-waste
◦ Designed the electronics-subsystem with servos to control bin lids, RFID scanners to scan IDs, BeagleBone AI board
to run DL models at edge, LCD to display bin no., SMPS for power management; Field tested at Campus Cafe, IITM
